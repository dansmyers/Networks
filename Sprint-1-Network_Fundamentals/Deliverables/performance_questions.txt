Part 1:

	Time to get on the link (bandwidth) = file size / bandwidth 

	megabytes to bits: 1MegaBit = 8 * 1MegaByte

	2 ** 20 = number of bits in 1 megabyte 8 * (2 ** 20) bits

	file size = (in bits) 8 * (2 ** 20) / 80 * (2 ** 20) (seconds) = 1/10 of a second = 100ms (ms = milliseconds)

	Travel time on the wire = latency 

	RTT (round trip time) = 20ms
	one way latency = 20ms / 2 = 10ms 

	Total time = 10ms + 100ms = 

	110ms of travel time

Part 2:

	Total travel time = time to get on the first wire + time to get on the second wire + time traveled on the wires

	time on the first wire:
		100ms (calculated in part 1)

	time on the second wire:

		time to get onto the wire (bandwidth) = file size / bandwidth
	
		file size = 1Mbyte = 8 * (2 ** 20) bits 
		bandwidth = 60 * (2 ** 20) bits/sec 
	
		8(2 ** 20) / 60(2 ** 20) = 2/15 of a second 2000/15ms or 133.3ms 
	
		time to get onto the second wire = 133.3 milliseconds 
	
	latency:
		RTT (round trip time) = 20ms
		one way latency = (RTT)/ 2 
		20ms/2 = 10ms 
	
	Total travel time:
		100ms + 133.3ms + 10ms = 
		
		243.3ms of travel time 
	
Part 3:
	
	Total travel time = time to get on the first wire + time to travel the first wire + time of the queued
	data to get on the second wire + time for the queued data to tavel the second wire + time for the data
	to get on the second wire + time for the data to travel the second wire 
	
	time for the data to get on and travel the first and second wires = 243.3ms (calculated from part 2)
	
	(512 * 8) * (2 ** 10) = number of bits in the second file 
	
	time to get on the wire = file size / bandwidth 
	
	4096 * (2 ** 10) / 60( 2 ** 20) = .067 sec or 67ms
	
	latency = 20ms / 2 = 10ms for one way
	
	10 / 2 = 5ms for one way on one wire
	
	= the 512KB file will take 72ms to complety tranfer along the second wire 
	
	total travel time = 243.3ms + 72ms = 
	
	315.3ms of travel time
