Part 1:

File size/bandwidth

1 MB/ (80 Mb/s) = ( 8 * 2^20 bits)/ (80 * 2^20 bits/sec)

Now flip the 2nd fraction to cancel out the units

(8 * 2^20 bits) * [( 1 sec)/ 80 * 2^20 bits)]

Cancel out bits and you are left with seconds. The 2^20 values cancel and 8/80 reduces to 1/10 or .10

(8 * 2^20 bits) * [( 1 sec)/ 80 * 2^20 bits)] = .1 sec or 100 ms 

Total time = RTT + time to get data copied onto wire

RTT needs to be divided by 2 since we only want one way latency

total time = (20/2) ms  + 100 ms = 110 ms

110 ms is the total amount of required to transmit the data from the sender to the destination


"""

"""

Part 2:

This time we are traversing two links so we need to do the following calculation to get the total time for transmission

total time = (time to get data on first link) + (time to get data on 2nd link) + RTT/2

first link is given from the first problem

time to get data on first link = 100 ms

Now do the second link:

[(8 * 2^20 bits)/ (60 * 2^20 bits/s)]

Flip the fractions and cancel out units to get seconds. The 2^20 also cancel and you are left with 8/60

8/60 = 2/15 

2/15 seconds to ms is 133.33 ms

Back to the origianl function for total time:

total time = 100 + 133.33 + (20/2)

total time = 243.33 ms

"""

"""

Part 3:

We will take the answer from part 2 and add on the total time it takes for the queued data to reach the destination. 

Queue data is 512 KB and the time to get on the 2nd link is 60 Mbps

512 KB = 8 * 512 * 2^10 bits

(4096 * 2^10 bits) / (60 * 2^20 bits/sec) = 

(68.2667/ 2^10 ) sec = .0667 sec

.0667 sec = 66.67 ms

There is also a latency for this data, which would equal the RTT/4 since the data starts on the 2nd link and would only traverse 1/4th of the total roundtrip distance from the sender to the destination.

66.67 ms + 5 = 71.67 ms

243.33 + 71.67 = 315 ms

total time = 315 ms
