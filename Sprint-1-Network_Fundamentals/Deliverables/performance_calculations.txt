Part 1:

File size/bandwidth

1 MB/ (80 Mb/s) = ( 8 * 2^20 bits)/ (80 * 2^20 bits/sec)

Now flip the 2nd fraction to cancel out the units

(8 * 2^20 bits) * [( 1 sec)/ 80 * 2^20 bits)]

Cancel out bits and you are left with seconds. The 2^20 values cancel and 8/80 reduces to 1/10 or .10

(8 * 2^20 bits) * [( 1 sec)/ 80 * 2^20 bits)] = .1 sec or 100 ms 

Total time = RTT + time to get data copied onto wire

RTT needs to be divided by 2 since we only want one way latency

total time = (20/2) ms  + 100 ms = 110 ms

110 ms is the total amount of required to transmit the data from the sender to the destination


"""

"""

Part 2:

This time we are traversing two links so we need to do the following calculation to get the total time for transmission

total time = (time to get data on first link) + (time to get data on 2nd link) + RTT/2

first link is given from the first problem

time to get data on first link = 100 ms

Now do the second link:

[(8 * 2^20 bits)/ (60 * 2^20 bits/s)]

Flip the fractions and cancel out units to get seconds. The 2^20 also cancel and you are left with 8/60

8/60 = 2/15 

2/15 seconds to ms is 133.33 ms

Back to the origianl function for total time:

total time = 100 + 133.33 + (20/2)

total time = 243.33 ms
