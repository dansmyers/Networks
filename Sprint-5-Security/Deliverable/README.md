# Global Weather Particles

## Description

Your standard weather app but using a typescript library called "tsParticles" and an external API called "OpenWeatherMap." The main focus of this  project
is to allow the user to flip through any city to see the weather, but *also* being able to interact with the weather particles in real-time. Of course, since during this time 
of year, some weather conditions may become extremely rare. In that case, they will be able to view any of the supported particle systems on screen as an override.

## Current Features (updated 12/18/2020)

- Viewable temperature and weather conditions for nearly all cities with a population greater than 15,000
- Particle simulator for certain weather conditions
- Ability to toggle/restart particle animations
- Ability to toggle sounds
- Particle interactivity with mouse clicks and hovering

## Cool Features that Could Be Added in the Future
- Background image that syncs to the current city's timezone and time of day
- More sandbox features like user being able to change number of particles on screen, or color of background, etc.
