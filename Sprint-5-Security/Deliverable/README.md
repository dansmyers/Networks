# Dynamic Weather Particles

## Description

Your standard weather app but using a typescript library called "tsParticles" and an external API called "OpenWeatherMap." The main focus of this  project
is to allow the user to flip through any city to see the weather, but *also* being able to interact with the weather particles in real-time. Of course, since during this time 
of year, some weather conditions may become extremely rare. In that case, they will be able to view any of the supported particle systems on screen as an override.

## Current Features (12/1/2020)

- Viewable temperature and weather conditions for select cities
- Crude weather simulator for certain weather conditions
- Ability to toggle particle animations on and off

## Features in Progress

- More weather conditions (haze, mist, hail, varying levels of rain intensity, etc.)
- Ability to type a city name for selection instead of a basic dropdown menu (major cities only for now)
- Better particle visuals (rain and clouds look very basic right now but can be vastly improved)
- Background image instead of a simple color or gradient that syncs to the current city's timezone and time of day
- Interactivity with the mouse and some keyboard keys (repulsion and attraction are built in to the custom API)
- Other stuff I can't think of currently
