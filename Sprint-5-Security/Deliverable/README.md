It's the final countdown.

We're now entering the last two sprints of the semester. Your goal for the rest of the course is to complete **your own, original, significant** web programming project. You're
free to choose anything that you want to create, with the following requirements:

- It must be awesome.

- You must use some type of web programming technology, but you don't have to restrict yourselves to the tools or frameworks we used in previous projects. You can also
add new tools and frameworks as you need to.

- No social media projects, rating sites or games. These projects will be hard to bring to a good conclusion in the time that we have, and social tools don't make any
sense without a potential user base.

- **Your project must be a complete piece of working software**. Even is the scope and functionality is small, your goal is to produce a real, working application that you
could plausibly show to a potential employer as a demonstration of your skills.

**A good project** is one that you could imagine hosting on a GitHub repository and seeing someone else download and use. Think creatively and consider projects that you
could feature as part of a portfolio, resume or interview discussion. Here are some ideas that I think have merit:

- Using an external API to build a page that incorporates maps, voice, audio, or some other type of interactive element.

- Any projects related to data collection, scraping, dashboards, and visualization.

- Implementing your own versions of web tools. For example, if you built your own small-scale Bootstrap-like CSS layout system, you'd undoubtedly learn a lot about CSS and front-end
design.

- A static site generator that can take a series of posts as separate text files and stitch them together with a style template to make a self-contained static web page. Jekyll
is the main one used by GitHub pages.

**You can use any resources that you find helpful**. You may find it productive to investigate other frameworks for building applications like Ruby on Rails, but don't let
yourself get too bogged down in making tooling decisions &ndash; choose something that works quickly and then go with it.

## Mid-Point Check-In

By the end of this sprint, your goal is to submit a **demonstration of your work-in-progress**. This means that you must have **working code** available for me to examine
and run. You do not need to have the complete application built and it's fine if there are important parts that are completely unimplemented, but you must have something
that establishes you are making concrete progress towards building working software. **General plans, specs, and ideas are not sufficient** &ndash; you won't have enough
time left to actually build anything by the end of the semester.

## Tips

- Doing some planning and prototyping is valuable, but don't waste too much time. **Start writing code as soon as possible**.

- Agility! Start building a rough concept and then refine it. Don't be afraid to refactor code and change things up: it's likely that the development process will help you
refine your ideas.

- Either do no styling or put effort into making the style look good and contemporary. Don't do a halfway job where you just, like, change the background color and it still
looks pretty bad.
