# My Original Project

## Introduction: Why am I Doing This Project

My group and I didn't really have much communication this semester, so I decided it was best for me to do it alone. Since I was on my own, I decided to do something specific to me. 

I am an international student from Ecuador. Being born and raised in Quito and going to college in Winter Park, always reminds me of the huge difference between two cities/countries.

When Covid came along, I was stuck in the United States for three months because Ecuador closed its borders. I saw how USA handled the pandemic, and I also saw how my family was dealing with it back home. When I finally got to go back home in July, it was one of the most shocking changes I've ever experienced. I went from not even having to use a mask in USA in June to being completely locked in my house. Ecuador took a lot of strict measures to decrease the spreading of coronavirus. We were in lockdown from 2pm to 9am every day, only one person could go in a car, masks were obligatory everywhere (even inside cars), etc. Ecuador came up with a method of stop lights. Each province is under a color of the stop light, depending on how bad the spreading is. Red means there is a lot of spreading, so there are more strict measures in place, and green means there is not much spreading, so the rules are alleviated. 

## My Project

For this project I will be using data from Quito, Ecuador to determine if the stop light method implemented was effective or not. To do this, I will try to graph the daily cases in Quito, possibly create a heatmap, and look for any trend or change that corresponds to a change in the city's stop light color. I will also try to predict in some way the behavior of covid spreading in Quito 

I got the csv values from a person also doing some reasearch on Ecuador's coronavirus
