2. Due to the fact that an IP network should be able to connect any type of technology that wants to join
   the network, IP does not make any guarentees about packet delivery. This is because it is impossible to
   define a standard for guarenteed delivery when IP is not able to make any guarentees about the hosts
   and routers that will be connected to the network. This ensures that any device connected to the
   network will be able to deliver the services required. This means that IP gives its best-effort to
   deliver a packet but will make no guarentee that the packet will acually arrive where it is supposed to
   go.
   
 3. The Internet Protocol needs to use IP addresses because they are hierarchical. This means that they
	are made up of different parts each of which corrosponds to a specific hierarchy in the network. 
	This structure usually consists of two different parts. The first part is the network part and the
	second part is considered the host part. The network part lets the router know what network the host
	is on and the second host part identifies the specific host on the network the package is ment for.
	On the other hand, the MAC address does not give this same information to the router. There is no way
	for a router to find which network to send the data to using the MAC address.
