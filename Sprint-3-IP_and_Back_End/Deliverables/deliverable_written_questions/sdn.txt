In networking the control plane are the processes and procedures
that control decisions on how to get from node a to node b. This 
is also called routing. On the other hand the data plane are the 
processes and procedures that control the next router or hop the 
data should take based on the data from the control plane. This is
also called forwarding. The control plane usually creates routing
tables and the data plane usually creates forwarding tables. The big
advantage that SDN offers is a NOS or Network Operating System which
provides an excellent abstraction of the data and control planes. 
This makes it much easier for the programmers to manage the Network.
Additionally, with this abstraction we can centralize the control 
plane to one CPU and have all of the routers build forwarding tables
based of the routing table created by that central CPU. This makes 
it much easier to build routers and makes them cheaper and more 
lightweight then they would if every router had to make routing 
decisions and forwarding decisions.
