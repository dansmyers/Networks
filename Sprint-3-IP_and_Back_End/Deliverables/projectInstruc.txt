For the project

Make a front-end page that has a search box, a button, and response div

On a click, get the search term from the box (assume this is one word)

The server looks up instances of that word in the plays and send back a JSON message that contains a list of objects with the information that you want to display as the search results.

On the server, make a route called /search to receive the term

You can use GET

When the server starts, it needs to read the texts of the plays and build an index

Index is a JS object where every word is mapped to a list of locations where that word occurs in the play

index['wherefore'] --> [locations where wherefore occurs in the plays]

To build the index:

1.) Scan the text files
2.) Break each line into its words

As you scan, keep track of the play, the act, the scene, the speaking character

For each word, create an object that records the word, act scene, play, character, etc.

{
    word: 'wherefore',
    play: 'Romeo and Juliet',
    act: 'II',
    scene: '2',
    line: 'Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?',
    character: 'Juliet'
}
