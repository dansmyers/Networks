# Challenge Project &ndash; React

## Due December 11 (one week before the end of classes)

## About React

React is a framework for developing front-end user interfaces. It was originally created at Facebook and is currently maintained by both the company and open-source
contributors. React is probably the current most-popular framework for building complex front-end applications

All of our previous front-end work has focused on raw HTML and CSS, supplemnted by the Bootstrap library. React exists to make it easier to build **reusable** interface
elements, which it calls **components**.

For example, think about a social media feed.

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/d0/61/d1d061a2fe437d3788013af256c33af2.jpg" width="50%" />

The feed is a series of posts with the same basic layout and presentation for each post. The **content** changes, but the structure remains the same. In React terms, the
basic post template would be a component; to create the complete feed, you would **render** a series of post component with each field (user tag, message body, likes, etc.)
filled in with the appropriate values for each post.

One of React's primary use cases is creating layouts that have repeated elements, where the content of the elements is determined by user interactions, but it can also
be used as a general engine for creating interactive web application front-ends.

## Project

This project is straightforward: simply work through and complete [the official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which uses React to build a 
Tic-Tac-Toe game. By the time you finish, you should have a decent concept of what React can do and can think about incorporating it in your future projects.

The tutorial framework gives you a way to code in the browser; you can use that and then save your final product to a document that you upload here. Note that you don't have
to do any problem solving for this project. Eveything that you need is given to you in the tutorial, including the complete code at each step. You just need to work through
everything. Please take the time to work through the complete tutorial and build your own implementation &ndash; don't just copy the solution!

You can also look at the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) for more discussion of the details of React.

## Submission

Upload your completed code to this directory in your repo. I will check for the completion of challenge projects after December 11, when I evaluate your last pull request.
You'll get full credit if you complete the full tutorial.
