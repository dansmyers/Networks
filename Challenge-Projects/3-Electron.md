# Challenge Project &ndash; Electron

## Due December 11

## Description

**Electron** is an application-development framework that allows you to create standalone desktop applications using web technologies. It is, essentially, an instance of Node.js
combined with the Chromium rendering engine used by the Chrome browser, allowing you to write code using HTML/CSS/JS that runs in a window like a regular desktop application.
Many popular tools are written in Electron, including Micorosoft's Visual Studio Code, the Atom text editor, and the Slack desktop app.

The main advantage of Electron is that it allows web-based applications to be ported relatively easily to desktop versions (as opposed to being completely written in a native
desktop format). The main criticism of Electron is that its apps tend to consume disproportionately huge amounts of memory as a consequence of running an entire instance of
Chromium.

The project is simple: **use Electron to build any non-trivial application**. Your project can do anything you want and use any combination of tools or styles, as long as it goes
beyond creating a simple `Hello, World` app.

That's it! We'll address any questions as they come up.
