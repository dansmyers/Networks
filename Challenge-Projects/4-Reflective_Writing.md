## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

During the beginning of the course I was expecting to learn a lot about networks in general including how computers talk to each other and the fundementals of how networks are built. As we went through the semester I did feel that I learned a lot about computer networking. In addition, we spent some time learning web development which I was not anticipating. Learning front end development was a weclome surprise and I feel that using front end development was a great way to consolidate our knowledge on networking in general. However, I wish that there were more assignments like the c webserver as I feel like those assignments really helped understand some of the abstract concepts we learned while talking about IP and TCP. 

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

On of the most difficult assignments in the class in my opionion was the c webserver. This project really challenged me to understand how http requests were formatted and sent from a server to a client. The majority of the difficulity in this project was understanding how the webserver was working. However, dispite this difficulity I really enjoyed learning how everything is working at a low level and feel that after working on that assignment my understanding of http was much more solid. Though this project was difficult I would really enjoy doing more of these types of projects and implementing all of the abstract concepts we learn in class.

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

During this class I worked with my scrum team often to figure out challenging projects together. One expample of this was during the search engine project I worked with Jacob, Lee, and Oliver to figure out how routes were working in express. This collaboration was very helpful as we were able to discuss our ideas and help each other which lead to better understanding for myself. I really enjoy scrum classes due to the group centered learning. 

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

One thing I have taken away from this class is that I believe that I learn much better in a group environment. The class this semester was mostly lecutre based which works but I felt that I understand concepts much better when learning in groups. This helps consolidate my knowledge and discussion with others helps me think about things from a different perspective. I also learned that doing many examples is critical for understanding concepts. Reading helps me learn the abstract concepts but doing many practice problems really helps me understand and remember those concepts.

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

I felt that learning during the pandemic was a little more challenging than during a normal semester. I believe that I learn much better in an in person class rather than in a virtual environment. In my in-person classes I have felt that my experience was much better than I had thought but the pandemic has made it more difficult to meet with friends outside of class to talk about what we have learned. Overall my experience has been mostly positive and I am very grateful we have had in person classes throughout the whole semester. 

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

Personally I feel that I learn much better in an in person environment. Being in class helps me focus better due to the classroom environment. I also feel that I am more productive in person as I am able to easily talk to my classmates and discuss what we have learned rather than a virtual environment where this is much more difficult. However, there are some positive aspects to online learning. I believe the biggest positive aspect to virtual class is the teachers ability to record lectures. This has been very helpful as I can go back and rewatch a lecture if I find myself needing to understand a concept discussed in class a little better. I hope that if classes return to in-person only students will still have the ability to record and watch lectures.

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?

As a result of this class I have found that I learn very well in a group environment by working on practice problems and discussing concepts. Without this I find that although I can still learn concepts I still feel uncomfortable working on problems during quizzes. Additionally I have found that it is vital to read all of the textbook chapters slowly and carefully and discuss the concepts with others or think about them slowly independentally. After doing these things I find that I really understand the concepts well and I do better on quizzes and have an easier time working on the programming assignments.
