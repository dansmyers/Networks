## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?
