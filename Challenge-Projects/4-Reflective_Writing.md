## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

<p>At the beginning of the semester, I came in with a general expectation that a networks course would cover front and back end programming concepts as well as HTTP Requests that I had begun to gain some familiarity with during my summer internship. However, I had little theoretical background on exactly how and why networks work the way they do, and why HTTP Requests and client-server relationships are the way they are. I also half expected to end up in virtual learning due to a campus wide quarantine following an on campus outbreak of COVID-19. Needless to say, I have been very pleasantly surprised by how the semester has gone on the COVID-19 front.</p>

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

<p>One project that I found particularly challenging was the Incremental Clicker Game. The starter code was straightforward and easy to understand, but building the game up from the ground level took a lot of careful planning, and required me to be really smart with my testing strategies. The further I went, the more complex the relationships among clickable feilds became. In spite of the degree of difficulty, I actually found the project highly enjoyable, and rose to it as a challenge to see what I could accomplish.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I settled on a structure in which the player starts with a magical hammer that can crush rocks into gravel, and producing gravel from rock increased a player's score (the number variable from starter code). Increases in score would first allow the player to upgrade his/her hammer or hire workers by spending points that represent monetary units. Once enough workers were hired, and the player would then gain the ability to open factories that increased the productivity of the workers inside them, and eventually unlock corporate HQ for 1,000,000 units. HQ would then open the doors to more complex operations such as upgrades to worker and factory productivity rates and contractors who would hire workers or build factories automatically. Victory is achieved through domination of the planet's gravel industry, which is defined as when the player produces enough gravel to amass 1 Quadrillion monetary units. An alert then appears announcing victory.</p>

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

<p>At breakfast one morning I was commiserating with my teammates about the amount of work we all had get done in the week leading up to finals week and I eventually got to mentioning the incremental clicker game that I had been working on. As the conversation progressed, I realized that I was able to explain at a high level of abstraction the fact that I the project was mostly focused on coding the front end component of the game. In that moment I realized that I had learned the concepts of behind computer networking quite well. In fact, I now know them well enough to talk about them in a future job interview.</p>

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

<p>Aside from programming, I have also learned a lot about the structure of computer networks and protocols associated with various layers. Before hand, for example, I was loosely aware of IP, TCP, and HTTP is internet protocols, but had no idea where they fit in to the actual structure of a computer network. I now understand that IP is the protocol that allows internetworking to work at best effort performance, TCP runs on IP and handles Internet performance issues, and HTTP is an application level protocol designed for communication between clients and servers over the Internet. Additiona;ly, I gained a lot of insight from the last couple of sprints on cryptography and other modern systems and technologies such as VMM's, Data Centers, and block chain technologies. All of this knowledge will help me greatly in my future career in Software Engineering.</p>

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

<p>My experience during the pandemic can be summed up by saying that everything ran differently and with a much greater degree of uncertainty than in the past, especially with regards to scheduling and budgeting my time. It took a couple of weeks to fully adjust, but I was able to adapt well and figure my life out for the most part. The most difficult thing for me was staying motivated and getting my work done. Increasing the amount of time I spent planning for things and adjusting my lifestyle to observe COVID related precautions was not too hard on its own, but adding that extra effort to my daily routine on a constant basis draining effect on my energy levels that would add up on me ovre the course of the day. It took me a couple weeks to fully adjust to that.</p>

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

<p>If I have learned anything from the implementation of online learning in my hybrid classes this semester, it was that having the option to tune into class virtually when you know you will not be able to make it person is actually quite useful in principle. Digital forums such as WebEx and Zoom are also really useful for organizing group meetings outside of class. That being said, I still view in person teaching as a superior method for college courses given that being physically in the room with the professor protects against the issue of technolgy failures such as the Wifi cutting out impeding the communication between in person students and the professor, and virtual students.</p>

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have you learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?

<p>While taking this class, I have learned that although I am able to learn much more effectively when I copy down extensive notes from a lecture, I do not gain much from attempting to visually navigate my own lengthy notes. Instead, I have found it much more effective to jump around the document holding all of my notes for the semester by using the search tool in Microsoft Word. Typing a word in the search bar and jumping directly to each small section that I intend to read actually saves me a lot of time and mental effort over remembering where to find each concept by visually scanning the whole body of notes.</p>
